# Virtual-Painter
A virtual painter app using OpenCV and MediaPipe that lets users draw, erase, and switch colors with hand gestures. The index finger acts as a brush, and two fingers activate selection mode to choose colors or the eraser. Real-time hand tracking makes drawing seamless and interactive.
